**AI-Powered Portrait Generation & Editing with Stable Diffusion
**

This project delivers an intelligent system for generating and editing lifelike human portraits from natural language prompts, powered by Stable Diffusion. It combines creative generation with targeted facial modifications, offering significant value in fields such as identity reconstruction, law enforcement, and digital content creation.

Use Case
Originally developed with investigative and forensic applications in mind, this system allows:

A user or eyewitness to describe a person’s appearance.

Automatic generation of a portrait based on that description.

Selective editing of facial features (e.g., changing eye color, adding scars).

Matching the final image to a facial database to suggest potential identities.

 Key Features

1. Text-to-Portrait Generation
Input a prompt like: "young man with curly brown hair and glasses"

Generates a realistic human portrait using Stable Diffusion’s text-to-image model

2. Feature-Specific Inpainting
Mask specific facial areas (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.)

Apply prompts such as "make eyes green", "add mole on left cheek"

3. Facial Embedding & Similarity Matching
Encodes the final portrait using CLIP embeddings

Compares it against a curated facial image database

Returns the top 3 visually similar faces

Modifies only the selected features, preserving the rest of the portrait
